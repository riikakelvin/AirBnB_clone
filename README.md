#STUMBLE

STUMBLE is a social Platform that allows users to discover and learn from unimaginable and amazing things that are being discovered (eg No Gravity on Mount Everest... Dunno if that's true though lol)

Users are also allowed and encouraged to share their discoveries on this platform so that we call all learn and be amazed together

The main purpose for the building of this platform was to prevent people from getting distracted by the moment they open the app

What I mean is let's say for example: You want to look for the latest news about the latest news on an asteroid falling into space but before you do that you might end up scrolling through tiktok or instagram looking at things that don't really matter

Even if you don't find what you're particularly looking for, there is no way you won't learn anything interesting on this app because everyday mindblowing things are being discovered and are posted here so you will be mind-boggled and be safe from cheap dopamine

Our team will ensure that you don't find anything that won't interest you, anything that will distract you from the real world or anything that could lead to one bearing the deadly sin of Envy. Rest assured

##So what are you waiting for?
